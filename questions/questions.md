# 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends

There are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array logs where logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi] indicates that xi and yi will be friends at the time timestampi.

Friendship is symmetric. That means if a is friends with b, then b is friends with a. Also, person a is acquainted with a person b if a is friends with b, or a is a friend of someone acquainted with b.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. If there is no such earliest time, return -1.

# 818. Race Car

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):

When you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:
position += speed
speed *= 2
When you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:
If your speed is positive then speed = -1
otherwise speed = 1
Your position stays the same.
For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.

Given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.
